# qcomputingorientation

The Computing Orientation website was completely overhauled, using JavaScript, HTML, and Sass to provide a new User Interface with designs and content relevant to 2023. The contents are well documented and named appropriately to facilitate ease of use and upkeep by future Orientation Chairs and Publications Chairs. The project also contains a YAML file to facilitate auto-deployment within CPanel.
