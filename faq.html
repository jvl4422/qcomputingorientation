                            <p>Computing Orientation is open to any incoming first year student or upper-year transfer student who is new to Queen's and the 
                            School of Computing! If you are not a computing student, you are welcome to sign up and join but our events, especially our academics-based ones, as they are tailored towards computing students.

                            <p>Computing Orientation is run by computing students for computing students! Our orientation is customized towards welcoming computing students to Queen's and is an amazing opportunity to connect with other students in your program and meet upper year students as well. We are running academic-based events to help break down courses, clubs, and everything you need to know coming into computing. Aside from that, we have many exciting events planned and LOTS of school spirit!</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>The computing orientation is designed to help you become familiar with the computing department, its facilities, and the academic expectations of the program. You can expect presentations, campus tours, information sessions, club fairs, and opportunities to meet faculty, staff, and fellow students.</p>

                            <p>While attendance at the orientation is usually not mandatory, it is highly recommended. The orientation provides valuable information about the computing program, resources, and services available to you. It is also a great opportunity to get acquainted with fellow students, faculty, and staff.</p>

                            <p>The Tech Committee, abbreviated as TC and synonymous with Orientation Chairs, is the group of students that oversee the planning of Computing Orientation. While TC as a group is responsible for the planning of all areas of Computing Orientation, they each have their own specific roles and responsibilities.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Techs are Orientation Leaders, who will aid in the organization of Orientation Events, and oversee their own Orientation Groups. To students, Techs will be your first point of contact, and is someone you can approach regarding any questions and concerns you may have.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">What should I bring for Orientation?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>
                                There are many things that we encourage all students bring with them to Orientation:
                                <li>Orientation T-Shirt</li>
                                Distributed at the beginning of Orientation, note that students should try to wear this shirt for the duration of Orientation. Importantly, it is a fixed size (XL) and so it is understandable if students are unable to wear the shirt, and so may have to bring other clothing to dress appropriately.
                                <li>Comfortable clothing</li>
                                Dress for the weather. Note that many Orientation activities will take place outside, and also in early-September. Dress appropriately for the weather (e.g., shorts).
                                <li>Comfortable shoes</li>
                                Orientation may require a lot of moving around, so make sure to prepare for this situation appropriately.
                                Clothing you wonâ€™t mind getting dirty
                                To be specific, note that at certain events (to be communicated with students during Orientation), students may have their clothes get wet or dirty. Importantly, coveralls (can be purchased at the time of Orientation registration) are traditionally brought to these events for this reason. Otherwise, we strongly encourage students to bring a different set of clothing that they may not mind getting wet, dirty, or painted.
